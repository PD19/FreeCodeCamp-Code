# FreeCodeCamp-Code
My coding challenges from the bootcamp

This repository isn't for an app or any project that I've completed, rather a log where I keep track of everything that I've completed and learned along the way from FreeCodeCamp. I had previously written out all of my solutions and code by hand (I have the binder full of notes to prove it), but I've decided to use a wiki as its easier to review past notes without fear of losing anything.
